## 3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO I RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?

***In Short:** I only process your personal information when I believe it is necessary and I have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill my contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.*

***<ins>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</ins>***

## 4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO I SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

I do not share information with any third parties.

## 5. HOW LONG DO I KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?

***In Short:** I keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.*

I will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 30 days.

When I have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, I will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then I will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

## 6. HOW DO I KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?

I have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information I process. However, despite my safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so I cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat my security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although I will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from my Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting me by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT ME ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.

## 8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized.

If a standard for online tracking is adopted that I must follow in the future, I will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
